### In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)  
I think they are related because they both help users can still use the functionality of the website even when parts of it is not working such as connection.  
Graceful degradation is making sure the website/application is working in all kinds of devices and browswers and it functions correctly.  
Service workers are similar since it also tries to ensure that users can access the website wven when they are offline by using cached data.  
this can help us make a good website that performs well in many bad conditions.
